# xcmsrocker: Rocker image for metabolomics data analysis

Software and data is required for reproducible research. However, detailed workflows connecting software and data would be the key to reproducible research in metabolomics studies. Xcmsrocker is a linux based [rocker](https://www.rocker-project.org/)/docker image to host the workflow of [R based metabolomics software]((https://yufree.cn/en/2018/01/17/use-docker-to-package-your-metabolomics-study/)). It includes multiple mainstream R packages used in metabolomics study with RStduio as IDE. Such image could be deployed on single machine or [cluster(HPC or cloud computing)](https://yufree.cn/en/2022/05/26/using-xcmsrocker-on-hpc-via-singularity/). 

Besides, `rmwf` package is attached in this image to provide detailed workflow template( File - New File - R Markdown - From Template - Select template with {rmwf}) and facilitate the users to perform metabolomics data analysis and/or comparisons. Specifically, paired mass distances dependent analysis (PMDDA) and reactomics analysis templates could be found here.

If you preferred to perform Python code within RStudio through reticulate package, you might try [metaborocker](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/yufree/metaborocker).

You are welcome to contribute your new algorithm/software/workflow! Just PR!

## Workflow template usage

1.  Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and run Docker in your system

2.  Pull the Rocker image `docker pull yufree/xcmsrocker:latest`

2.1 If you don't use RStudio and only run R script on HPC, you can use `sif` version: `docker pull yufree/xcmsrocker:sif`

2.2 If you preferred running image on computer with ARM processor (M1 or Raspberry pi), you can use `arm` version: `docker pull yufree/xcmsrocker:arm`

3.  Use `docker run -e PASSWORD=xcmsrocker -p 8787:8787 yufree/xcmsrocker` to start the image

3.1 If you need to access your local data on current directory, you can use `docker run -v $(pwd):/home/rstudio/$USER -e PASSWORD=xcmsrocker -p 8787:8787 yufree/xcmsrocker`

4.  Open the browser and visit <http://localhost:8787> or [http://[your-ip-address]:8787](http://%5Byour-ip-address%5D:8787) to power on RStudio server

5.  Default user name is `rstudio` and password is `xcmsrocker`

6.  Enjoy your data analysis! If you preferred to try PMDDA workflow, do the following step in RStudio:

-   Go to File - New File - Rmarkdown...
-   Click 'From Template'
-   Choose 'PMDDA Metabolomics Workflow' and click OK
-   You will see a Rmd file with PMDDA data analysis script.

Step 2-6 could be visualized:
