# xcmsrocker

Rocker image for metabolomics data analysis

For Java, you could select [MSDK](https://msdk.github.io/).

For C/C++, you could select [openms](https://www.openms.de/) or [ProteoWizard](http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net/).

For C#, you could select [Prime](http://prime.psc.riken.jp/).

For Matlab, you could select [Bioinformatics Toolbox](https://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/protocols/4347#).

For python, you could select [emzed](http://emzed.ethz.ch/index.html).

However, I suggest this R-based image for starter and hopefully we could see a Julia platform in the future.

## Usage

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

2. Pull the Rocker image `docker pull yufree/xcmsrocker:latest`

3. Use `docker run -e PASSWORD=rstudio -p 8787:8787 rocker/rstudio` to start the image

4. Open the browser and visit http://localhost:8787 or http://[your-ip-address]:8787 to power on RStudio server

5. Default user name and password are both `rstudio`

6. Enjoy your data analysis!
